Dear Professor [Last Name],

I hope this email finds you well. My name is [Your Name], and I had the pleasure of being in your [course name] class last year. I trust you remember me; we discussed [specific topic or project].

I am reaching out to express my sincere gratitude for the letter of recommendation you provided me last year. Your guidance and mentorship as my faculty advisor were invaluable during our time together, and I greatly appreciated your support.

Unfortunately, due to unforeseen personal reasons, I was unable to join [University/Program] last year. Now, as I am in the process of reapplying, I am seeking your support in writing another letter of recommendation for me.

Given our close academic relationship and your familiarity with my goals and achievements, I believe your insights would provide a strong recommendation for my application. If you are willing to write a letter of recommendation, I can provide you with additional information, such as my updated resume, a summary of my academic and extracurricular achievements since we last interacted, and any specific points you may wish to include in the letter.

The deadline for submission of the recommendation letter is [mention the deadline], and I understand that this is a busy time for you. I truly appreciate your time and consideration in assisting me with this request. Your previous support as my faculty advisor and in providing a letter of recommendation has been instrumental in my academic journey, and I am grateful for the opportunity to seek your guidance once again.

Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Warm regards,
